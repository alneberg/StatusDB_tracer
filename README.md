# StatusDB_tracer
Attempting to document which StatusDB views are used where with static code analysis


## Ideas
 - Create a graph showing statusdb views connections to it's python sources where it's used.
 - Manual curation as JSON to resolve variables
 - For genomics status, python usage can be linked to URLs automatically?
 - Annotate statusdb_views with usage
    - Maybe even links to github?
- Visualise on genstat?


## To Dos
  - Create csv/tsv output
  - Need to link statusdb_view files to the python sources which can be named slightly differently
  - Track which manual curation rows have been used to see if something is deprecated
